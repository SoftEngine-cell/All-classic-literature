## Redox Calculations and Problems

### Example 1: Normality and Equivalent Weight

**Question:** Calculate the normality of 0.1 M KMnO₄ solution in acidic medium.

**Solution:**
- n-factor of KMnO₄ in acidic medium = 5
- Normality = Molarity × n-factor
- Normality = 0.1 × 5 = 0.5 N

**Solution:**
```
For KMnO₄: n-factor = 5
For Fe²⁺: n-factor = 1

Milliequivalents of KMnO₄ = Milliequivalents of Fe²⁺
20 × 0.02 × 5 = 25 × M × 1
2 = 25M
M = 0.08 M
```

### Example 3: Oxalic Acid Estimation

**Question:** 0.2 g of oxalic acid is dissolved in water and titrated with KMnO₄. Calculate the volume of 0.1 N KMnO₄ required.

**Solution:**
```
Equivalent weight of oxalic acid (H₂C₂O₄·2H₂O) = 126/2 = 63
Number of gram equivalents = 0.2/63

Volume of KMnO₄ = (0.2/63) × 1000 / 0.1
Volume = 31.75 mL

## Answers to Selected Questions

### Short Answers

**1. Why is KMnO₄ called a self-indicator?**
KMnO₄ is called a self-indicator because it has an intense purple color in its oxidized form. During titration in acidic medium, it gets reduced to colorless Mn²⁺. At the endpoint, even one drop of excess KMnO₄ gives a permanent pink color, eliminating the need for an external indicator.

**3. Oxidation state of chromium in K₂Cr₂O₇:**
```
K₂Cr₂O₇
2(+1) + 2(x) + 7(-2) = 0
2 + 2x - 14 = 0
2x = 12
x = +6
```

### Numerical Solution

**Problem 1:**
```
Given: V₁ = 20 mL, M₁ = 0.1 M (KMnO₄)
       V₂ = 25 mL, M₂ = ? (FeSO₄)

For KMnO₄: n-factor = 5 (in acidic medium)
For Fe²⁺: n-factor = 1

M₁V₁n₁ = M₂V₂n₂
0.1 × 20 × 5 = M₂ × 25 × 1
10 = 25M₂
M₂ = 0.4 M
```
