# Primary and Secondary Batteries - CBSE Class 12 Chemistry

## Introduction to Electrochemical Cells

An **electrochemical cell** is a device that converts chemical energy into electrical energy through redox reactions. These cells are fundamental to our understanding of electrochemistry and have numerous practical applications in everyday life.

Electrochemical cells are broadly classified into two categories:
1. **Primary Cells (Non-rechargeable batteries)**
2. **Secondary Cells (Rechargeable batteries)**

## Primary Batteries

### Definition
**Primary batteries** are electrochemical cells that cannot be recharged once their chemical reactants are exhausted. These batteries are designed for single use and must be discarded after their energy is depleted. The chemical reactions in primary cells are **irreversible**.

### Characteristics
- Non-rechargeable
- Chemical reactions are irreversible
- Once the reactants are consumed, the battery becomes useless
- Generally have higher energy density
- Lower self-discharge rate
- More cost-effective for low-drain devices

### Common Examples of Primary Batteries

**Cell Reactions:**

*At Anode (Oxidation):*
```
Zn(s) → Zn²⁺ + 2e⁻
```

*At Cathode (Reduction):*
```
MnO₂ + NH₄⁺ + e⁻ → MnO(OH) + NH₃
```

*Overall Reaction:*
```
Zn(s) + 2MnO₂(s) + 2NH₄⁺ → Zn²⁺ + 2MnO(OH) + 2NH₃
```

## Secondary Batteries

### Definition
**Secondary batteries** are electrochemical cells that can be recharged by passing electric current in the opposite direction. The chemical reactions in these batteries are **reversible**. After the energy is depleted, these batteries can be recharged and used multiple times.

### Characteristics
- Rechargeable

**Cell Reactions:**

**During Discharge (Battery providing power):**

*At Anode (Oxidation):*
```

## Electrochemistry Concepts for CBSE Class 12

### Standard Electrode Potential
The tendency of an electrode to lose or gain electrons when in contact with its own ions in solution. It is measured relative to the Standard Hydrogen Electrode (SHE).

### Nernst Equation
Used to calculate the electrode potential at non-standard conditions:

```
E = E° - (RT/nF) ln Q
```

At 25°C (298 K):
```
E = E° - (0.0591/n) log Q
```

Where:
- E = Electrode potential at given conditions
- E° = Standard electrode potential
- R = Universal gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)
- T = Temperature in Kelvin
- n = Number of electrons transferred
- F = Faraday's constant (96500 C/mol)
- Q = Reaction quotient

### Gibbs Free Energy and EMF
The relationship between Gibbs free energy change and cell potential:

```
ΔG° = -nFE°cell
```

For spontaneous reactions: ΔG° < 0, which means E°cell > 0
